ann">Ted Mann</a>, Bloomberg</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Ever since President Donald Trump stepped into the White House Rose Garden to announce the largest US tariffs on imported goods in modern history, he and his top economic advisers have repeatedly said that no company, big or small, would be spared.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Holding up a poster board detailing punitive duties on goods from dozens of countries, from China to Lesotho, Trump said any economic pain caused by his tariffs was necessary to spark an industrial revival and “make America wealthy again.”</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>“To any company that objects to our common sense reciprocal tariffs,” Trump warned, “if you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America.”</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Even as Trump has threatened to increase tariffs yet again on any country that won’t sign on to a deal with the US by Friday, though, another dynamic is emerging: With far less fanfare, Trump has been letting plenty of companies—and entire industries—off the hook, often with no explanation.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Since April 2, or “Liberation Day” as Trump calls it, his administration has excluded more than a third of US imports by value. More than $1 trillion of these excluded materials and products were delivered to the US in 2024, according to a Bloomberg analysis of federal trade data. That includes about $750 billion excluded from his April 2 tariffs plus $400 billion or so covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement free trade pact, under which Trump gave cars and other products a break on new duties.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {"id":269,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-269" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>So far, in the two months following Trump’s Rose Garden event, the lucrative carve-outs have allowed companies to save roughly $16 billion to $19 billion by avoiding tariffs on an estimated $147 billion in excluded goods that landed at US ports, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of April and May trade data.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>How the coveted exclusions are granted, or the process by which a company can secure one, are among the most vexing questions in Washington today. Trump’s first administration established official means by which importers could request an exclusion. This time around, there are no such formalities. Instead, the rules of engagement are ad hoc, bordering on a free-for-all.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The biggest beneficiaries have been large tech companies, such as Chinese PC-maker Lenovo Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co., with that sector avoiding more than $7 billion in tariffs. Others come from a wide range of industries, including oil and gas, bitcoin mining operations and medical device makers. Importers of pharmaceuticals, including UK-listed generic drugmaker Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc and Germany’s Fresenius SE &amp; Co., collectively saved at least $3.8 billion.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {"id":274,"width":"620px","height":"auto","aspectRatio":"0.45410329476659683","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png?w=465" alt="" class="wp-image-274" style="aspect-ratio:0.45410329476659683;width:620px;height:auto" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Those that haven’t been able to secure an exclusion have paid a heavy cost. Retail giants Home Depot Inc. and Walmart Inc. are among the largest importers of the type of goods hit by Trump’s trade war. Firms in the retail industry, in particular those importing domestic appliances, household goods, and apparel, rang up at least $1.8 billion in additional tariffs in April and May, according to Bloomberg’s analysis. Smaller American manufacturers have watched the tariffs erase profits and cast doubt on their future.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The White House says that the vast majority of excluded categories are for products that will eventually be subject to so-called sectoral tariffs, including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors for which Trump has promised duties soon, or that were already subject to other new tariffs. Bloomberg’s analysis found that at least 186 product categories, including coal, rubber and nylon, don’t fit into any impending sectoral investigations. Imports in those product categories were worth $190 billion in 2024.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>“The Trump administration has not granted exemptions to the President’s reciprocal tariffs to benefit any one industry over another,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an email. “The Administration is taking a nuanced, strategic approach to level the playing field for American workers and reshore the high-tech manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security.”</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Despite the administration’s insistence that it is not favoring particular industries, even new tariffs announced this week have exempted some foreign goods. On Wednesday, the White House unveiled an executive order applying an additional 40% tariff on Brazilian imports, while exempting almost 700 categories of products from the new duties, including Brazil nuts, orange juice and pig iron. Similarly, the scope of new tariffs on copper imports was scaled back after lobbying by the industry.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Many of the exclusions reflect the tension between Trump’s desire to rewrite the rules of global trade, while also minimizing damage to an economy for which he has promised a “golden age.” Others reveal how Trump views tariffs as a bargaining chip—deals with the European Union and UK included carve-outs as he also pushed to draw investment by their companies in US manufacturing. And some appear to have been granted to industries essential to the US economy or critical to national security.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Exclusions on certain goods such as oil and gas, or smartphones and laptops, have the effect of cushioning the blow of the broader tariffs on consumers, says Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. The tradeoff, though, is that they generate “uncertainty surrounding tariffs in a way that's likely to both dampen business activity and divert firms’ efforts into lobbying rather than production.”</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Some products that have won exclusions, including coral and asbestos, appear to have been awarded without any rhyme or reason. In other cases, exclusions have followed direct appeals from executives or other industry leaders. Trump himself mentioned Apple’s CEO by name in April, saying “I helped Tim Cook recently” after the White House announced that smartphones would be spared.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In the balance, companies have been left to navigate deep uncertainty unleashed by a president intent on bending the global economy to his will. As a result, companies are desperate to figure out whether they’ll be lucky enough to secure a break.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The lack of transparency has touched off a frenzy as corporate executives, trade lawyers and lobbyists desperately try to figure out how their companies or clients can end up on the right side of the ledger. They’re dispatching emissaries to plead their cases to cabinet officials or agency heads or White House aides. In the end, as with many things, exclusions appear to rest on decisions made personally by Trump.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>For companies facing financial ruin, no effort is too great if they can win what has essentially become the economic equivalent of a presidential pardon.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><strong>‘Absolute shock’</strong><br>As Trump unveiled his new tariffs on April 2, one of the people watching was Lance Ruttenberg, the third-generation owner and chief executive of the American Textile Company, a century-old bedding maker.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>He and his top executives had gathered that day at the company’s headquarters in the gritty former steel town of Duquesne along the Monongahela River southeast of Pittsburgh. The building is on the site of a former US Steel plant and, as Ruttenberg likes to tell visitors, JP Morgan (the man rather than the bank) is on the original deed.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>They knew to expect something big. American Textile, one of the world’s largest pillow makers, had endured the first Trump administration, which had implemented sweeping tariffs that hit its supply chain for mattress pads and pillows. Ruttenberg had also paid attention as Trump threatened new import taxes on the 2024 campaign stump and in his first few weeks in office.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>But the severity of this new round stunned the bedding executives.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>“It was just absolute shock,” says American Textile general counsel Erin Ickes, one of the executives in the room that day, who remembers how the announcement registered on everyone’s faces.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The executive team quickly realized the new duties “were significant enough that they could put American Textile out of business,” Ruttenberg recalls. He set about canceling orders and figuring out how to deal with products that were already at sea, to avoid facing a potentially devastating bill.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Ruttenberg also latched on to another idea. During Trump’s first administration, American Textile had secured relief from tariffs via exclusions. Because all its pillows and mattress pads are made in the US, Ruttenberg figured that he’d have no problem doing so again.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><strong>Eight tariff codes</strong></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Dating to the start of his first presidential campaign, Trump has threatened to use tariffs as a tool to induce manufacturing back to the US.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Every year, the US imports more than $3 trillion worth of goods of all kinds, from finished products like tennis shoes and T-shirts and smart phones, to raw materials and inputs that are key to countless American companies’ supply chains. Meanwhile, the number of US manufacturing jobs has hovered at just under 13 million for the past few years, down from a peak of nearly 20 million in 1979, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>After taking office in 2017, Trump ordered tariffs on a wide swath of imported goods from China worth $370 billion a year, as well as separate tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, and raw materials like steel and aluminum.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>But his trade war lacked the bite he promised. Trump’s first-term tariffs were targeted at key countries like China and certain industries clamoring for protection, such as US steelmakers. They were also paired with protracted negotiations that meant it took two years to fully implement the tariffs Trump decided on. Even then, his administration held back on some duties and created a formal process to allow companies to petition for certain exclusions.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Separate processes run by the Office of the US Trade Representative and Department of Commerce allowed companies to apply for exclusions via a web portal. That led to a tidal wave of applications that became a matter of public record. The China tariffs alone attracted more than 50,000 applications for exclusions ranging from big companies to small businesses arguing that the relief they needed was for products that were available only from Chinese suppliers.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Eight applications came from American Textile.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Founded in 1925 by five Ruttenberg brothers in downtown Pittsburgh, the company sold its first product—mattress covers—to Sears, Roebuck and Co. It weathered the Great Depression with its patented covers for ironing boards. For a while, it manufactured American flags.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>After World War II, and for the next 80 years, the company continually reinvented itself as globalization unleashed a fundamental economic reordering. The changes lifted some poor nations out of poverty and almost universally lowered the cost of production, but it also hit many American industries and factory towns hard. The textile industry was among the worst casualties.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>American Textile pivoted. It stopped cutting and sewing its own pillowcases in the US and started filling imported pillow shells instead. It developed niche products like allergen-free bedding. It set up a plant in El Salvador to take advantage of a US trade agreement. And it took advantage of cheaper and sometimes better materials it could get offshore to keep significant operations going in the US. In time, like countless other US companies, even its American-made goods were the product of raw materials and labor sourced from around the world.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Founded in 1925 by five Ruttenberg brothers in downtown Pittsburgh, the company sold its first product—mattress covers—to Sears, Roebuck and Co.

The privately held company has five US factories that employ more than 1,000 workers.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In July 2020, Ruttenberg’s company won exclusions on five of the eight tariff codes for which it applied. The exemptions covered imported inputs from China, including the pillow shells and mattress protectors.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Though the exclusions were a reprieve, Ruttenberg regarded Trump’s tariffs as a shot across American Textile’s bow. For decades, the company’s supply chain delivered a clear advantage. But its CEO had also been feeling uneasy about the extent to which his company relied on China even before Trump’s first tariffs went into effect.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>He responded by creating a “China Zero” team that was tasked with figuring out how to move more of the firm’s supply chain out of the country. He began looking at alternate manufacturing in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>By the time Trump returned to office in January, Ruttenberg says, almost 70% of American Textile’s inputs were coming from outside China.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br><br></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br><br><br><br></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p><br></p> <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
